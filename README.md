# Robotic-final-Yolov8-Deepsort-

Project for ROBOTIC FINAL FALL 2025

This is a robotic project Multi-Object Tracking Robot using SORT/DeepSORT + YOLOv8 (AI + ONNX Deployment).

Check for the trained and ready to deployed materials, no need to hassle and go through the hard thing. done ready to go. 

This model is trained with 100 epochs to produce which took almost 2 hours.
The method used to train is advanced and complex but did achieve a high level of accuracy in result of deployment through keeping the performance preserved based on the pre-trained Yolov8 Model combining with additional training on needed classes.

The total class of the model are 82 classes with two additional classes added to fit the project goal.
